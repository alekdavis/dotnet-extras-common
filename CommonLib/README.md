# DotNetExtras.Common Library

The `DotNetExtras.Common` library implements general-purpose classes that can simplify common tasks in various .NET Core projects.

Use the `DotNetExtras.Common` library to:

- Retrieve error information from exceptions, including immediate and inner exceptions.
- Perform simple JSON serialization and deserialization.
- Utilize string functions to generate tokenized strings from collections.
- Clone and compare objects deeply.
- Get and set object values using compound (nested) property names.
- Convert strings to strongly-typed data types including dates, times, and collections.
- Validate content formats such as JSON, HTML, and common patterns using built-in regular expressions.
- Access enumeration metadata like descriptions, abbreviations, and custom attributes.
- Check if objects are empty or determine type characteristics (primitive vs. complex).
- Convert objects to dynamic types and perform advanced type introspection.
- Generate fully qualified or camelCase names for variables, types, and members using the NameOf utility.
- Retrieve application assembly information including company, version, and product details.
- Escape special characters for LDAP queries and SQL statements.
- Convert collections to comma-separated strings with customizable delimiters and formatting.
- Parse delimited strings into typed collections (lists, arrays, dictionaries, hash sets).
